The water of the hot spring (57 °C) contains small doses of sulphur flavour when heated to 100 °C.
There is a Bathing Complex of Govt. of Odisha at Atri. Not far from the Hot spring there is a shrine of Lord Hattakeswar Mahadev. The temple is the venue of a grand annual fair, Makar Jatra, on the day of Makar Sankranti (mid January). On this day the visitors congregate in large numbers to worship Lord Hatkeshwar to fulfill their desires and they also bathe in the ponds hoping to cure their diseases.
