History[edit]
This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Excavation at villages nearby by Balasore has given evidence for three distinct cultural phases of human settlements, viz.,  Chalcolithic (2000-1000 BCE),  Iron Age (1000-400 BCE) and early historic period (400-200 BCE).[4]
Baleswara district was part of the ancient Kalinga kingdom which later became a territory of Utkal, till the death of Mukunda Deva. It was annexed by the Mughal Empire in 1568 and remained as a part of their suzerainty up until the 1700s.
The British East India Company (EIC) established a factory at Balasore in 1633. In 1719, the Trieste Company merchants established a trading post there.[5] As Calcutta rose in importance, Balasore became the center for river pilot services for vessels seeking to ascend the Hooghli River. The city was bombarded by forces of the East India Company during the Anglo-Mughal War in 1686 however the Company was repulsed by the Mughal forces.
The old Pipili port was located near Baliapal north of Balasore along the coast near Subarnarekha.[6] The Portuguese arrived for trade and commerce, exporting Orissa products like rice, cotton and butter from Malaysia to Borneo, and bringing Chinese products and spices from Indonesia.
The Marathas then occupied this part of Odisha and it became a part of the dominion of the Bhonsle Maratha Rajas of Nagpur. They ceded this part through the Treaty of Deogaon in 1803 and it became a part of British Bengal Presidency until 1912.
Balasore as a separate district was created in October 1828 under the Bengal Presidency. On 7 November 1845, all of Danish India was sold to the British to form a  part of British India.
With the creation of Bihar Province, Odisha, along with Balasore district, was transferred from Bengal to Bihar. But with the creation of Odisha as a separate state on 1 April 1936, Balasore became an integral part of Odisha State. The national movement of independence surged ahead with the visit of Mahatma Gandhi in 1921. Similarly Praja Andolan was initiated against the ruler of Nilagiri State. The state of Nilagiri merged with state of Odisha in January 1948 and became a part of Balasore district. On 3 April 1993, Bhadrak sub-division became a separate district and from this day Balasore remains a district of Odisha with two Sub-divisions namely Balasore and Nilagiri having eight Tehsils, namely Balasore, Soro, Simulia, Nilagiri, Jaleswara, Basta, Baliapal and Remuna and 12 blocks namely Bhograi, Jaleswar, Baliapal, Basta, Balasore, Remuna, Nilagiri, Oupada, Khaira, Soro and Bahanaga. The name of the district is being derived from the name of the town.
Balasore is where the famous freedom fighter Jatindranath Mukherjee, also known as Bagha Jatin, was injured and died fighting the British.[7]

Geography[edit]
Climate[edit]
Balasore, located in the Indian state of Odisha, has a tropical climate characterized by high humidity and hot temperatures throughout the year. The summers, which last from March to May, are particularly hot, with temperatures often reaching up to 40°C. May is typically the hottest month of the year in Balasore.
The winter season, which runs from December to February, is relatively cooler with an average temperature range of 16°C to 27°C. This period is the most comfortable time to visit Balasore as the weather is relatively mild and pleasant.
Monsoon season starts in June and lasts until September, bringing heavy rainfall to the city. Balasore's proximity to the Bay of Bengal makes it vulnerable to cyclonic storms during the monsoon season. However, the city generally enjoys pleasant evenings with cool breeze most of the times, providing relief from the heat during the summer months.
Balasore is also known for its sand dunes, which are a common feature of the city. The region is often referred to as the "Sand City" due to the abundance of sand dunes. The average rainfall in the district is around 1568.4 mm, which is largely due to the monsoon season.
Overall, Balasore's climate can be challenging for visitors who are not used to hot and humid weather. However, the city's sand dunes, pleasant evenings, and relatively cooler winters make it an interesting destination to explore for those willing to brave the heat.
