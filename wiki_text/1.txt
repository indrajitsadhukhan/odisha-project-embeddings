From today's featured article


Norman Rockwell in 1921

Marriage License is an oil painting by American illustrator Norman Rockwell (pictured) created for the cover of the June 11, 1955, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It depicts a young man and woman filling out a marriage license application at a government building in front of a bored-looking clerk. Although the room and its furnishings are dark, the couple are illuminated by the window beside them. The contrast between the couple and the clerk highlights two reoccurring themes in Rockwell's works: young love and ordinary life. The painting has been praised by critics and compared to the works of Johannes Vermeer due to the use of light and dark. The painting is in the Norman Rockwell Museum's collection and has been a part of major exhibitions in 1955, 1972, and 1999. In 2004 the magazine Mad published a parody of Marriage License that depicted a pair of gay men, seen as a commentary on competing meanings of marriage and the government's role in deciding whether same-sex marriage is valid.

Today's featured picture






The Belle Tout Lighthouse is a decommissioned lighthouse and British landmark located at Beachy Head, East Sussex, close to the town of Eastbourne. The cliffs near Beachy Head saw numerous shipwrecks in the 17th and early 18th centuries and a petition to erect a lighthouse started around 1691. Despite this, the lighthouse was not built until 1828, initially as a temporary wooden structure, and then as a permanent granite lighthouse which was designed by Thomas Stevenson and became operational in 1834. The light was provided by a three-sided rotating array of oil lamps with ten lamps on each side, each lamp mounted within a parabolic reflector. The Belle Tout lighthouse was decommissioned in 1902, when the replacement Beachy Head Lighthouse was built at the bottom of the cliffs. In 1999, the Grade II listed building was moved in one piece to prevent it from succumbing to coastal erosion, and since 2010 it has operated as a luxury bed and breakfast.
