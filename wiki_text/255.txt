Sundaresvara Tank is located in the south of Sundaresvara Siva temple across the Sundaresvara road, Old Town, Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa. It is now under the care and maintenance of Sri Sri Dadhivamana Sundaresvara Mahadeva Trust Board. The tank is enclosed within a masonry embankment made of dressed laterite blocks.
