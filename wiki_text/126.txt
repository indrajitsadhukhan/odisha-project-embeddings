The pista has three mouldings, which is decorated with series of khakhara mundi. The anuratha paga(main portion) has series of khakhara mundis in succession, lotus cup in anuraha paga and 10 bhumi amlas in the kanika pagas. Two udyota lions are noticed in the gandi of rahapaga. At the base of the gandi in the frontal wall there is a miniature rekha angasikhara.
The doorjambs are decorated with three vertical bands of puspa sakha, patra sakha and lata sakha from exterior to interior. At the base of the doorjambs there are khakhara mundis on either sides. The deity of Lalatabimba Gajalaxmi is seated in lalitasana. In the architrave right above the jamb there is a navagraha panel, each graha within a niche. Surya (Sun god) holds lotus in his hands. Ketu (serpent god) is in serpent tail and holds bow in his left and a shield in the right hand. The temple is maintained by Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.
