Manikarnika tank is located beyond the southern compound wall of the Kapilesvara temple precinct, in the outskirt of the village Kapilesvara, Old Town, Bhubaneswar. It is now under the care and maintenance of Kapilesvara Trust Board. The tank is enclosed within a masonry embankment made of both dressed sandstone and laterite blocks.


Tradition & legends[edit]
According to the local legend goddess Parvati while engaged in her fight with the demons Kirtti and Basa lost her ear rings that were studded with gem (mani). After killing the demons Parvati told lord Siva about the earrings (mani-kundala) which she lost. Lord Siva with his trident struck upon the earth on the Kapila Kunda, from where the ear-rings were recovered. Parvati offered the ear-rings to Lord Kapilesvara. Hence another name of Kapilesvara is Kapila-muni and the kunda or tank where from the ear-rings were recovered was known as Manikarnesvara kunda or tank. Every day Lord Kapilesvara is given ritual bath with the waters of Manikarnika tank. Hence the tank is held in high esteem

Physical description[edit]
Surrounding[edit]

On the northern embankment there are a series of temples namely Pamesvara, Chakresvara, Bakresvara, Kardamesvara, Chitresvara and a Hanumana temple.

Orientation[edit]
Bathing Ghats are provided with steps in the northern embankment which has nine ghats and one each in western and southern embankments.
