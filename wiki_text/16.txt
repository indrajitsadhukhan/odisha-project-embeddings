External links modified[edit]
Hello fellow Wikipedians,
I have just added archive links to one external link on Tourism in Odisha. Please take a moment to review my edit. If necessary, add {{cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{nobots|deny=InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:

Added archive https://web.archive.org/20090206164040/http://www.chilika.com:80/eco.htm to http://www.chilika.com/eco.htm
When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the checked parameter below to true to let others know.
