Talasari Beach is a beach in the Baleswar district of Odisha, India. It lies on the north-eastern coast of India.
The name Talasari is derived from the two words Tala (ତାଳ) (meaning Palm) and Sari/Sarani (ସାରି/ସାରଣୀ) (meaning row). The palm trees surrounding the place gives such a name to it.[1] The word Tala also means rhythm, which is reflected in the sea waves lapping against the shore.
Talasari is among the cleanest beaches in Odisha. This beach is situated in Odisha’s Baleswar district. The word ‘Talasari’ means a row of palm leaves in the Odia language. The rows of palm trees along the Talasari beach beautify the beach, making it among the travelling places in India. 
The flowing Subarnarekha river adds to the visual appeal of the Talasari beach by few more levels. In addition to this, The Talasari beach has sand dunes and red crabs that add features to the beach. The fishing hamlets and the mangrove trees of Bichitrapur located near this beach attract travelers to the location.
