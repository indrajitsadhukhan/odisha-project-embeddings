Odisha State Museum is a museum in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. In its original form it was established in 1932 and later moved to the current building in 1960.[1] The museum is divided into eleven sections, viz, Archaeology, Epigraphy, Numismatics, Armoury, Mining & Geology, Natural History, Art & Craft, Contemporary Art, Patta Painting, Anthropology and Palmleaf Manuscripts.[1] The museum is headed by a superintendent and the administrative control lies in the hands of Cultural Affairs Department, Government of Odisha.


History[edit]
The origin of this museum can be traced back to 1932, when some historians and professors, like William Jones, Ghanashyam Das, N. C. Banerjee, Harekrushna Mahatab established a museum in Ravenshaw College, Cuttack. In 1945–46, the museum was shifted to Brahmananda building in old Bhubaneswar and given the status of a state museum by the government of Odisha.[1] Later, the museum was shifted to Patel Hall in 1950 and again to another building in Unit - I, Bhubaneswar. In 1957, the foundation of the museum was laid by then president of India Rajendra Prasad, and finally the museum in the current building started operating from 1960.[1]
