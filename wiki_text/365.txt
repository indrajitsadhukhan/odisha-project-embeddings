Paradeep, also spelled Paradip (originally Paradweep, also spelled Paradwip), is a major seaport city and municipality, 53 km (33 mi) from Jagatsinghpur city, in Jagatsinghpur district of Odisha, India. Paradeep was constituted as an NAC on 27 September 1979 and converted into a municipality on 12 December 2002.[3] The nearest commercial airport is Biju Patnaik International Airport.[4]
The municipality comprises five Revenue Villages, namely Udachandrapur, Chauliapalanda, Sandhakuda, Bijayachandrapur, and Bhitaragarh. Given the increasing population and industrialisation, a proposal to include 15 villages (Paradeep, Garh, Niharuni, Niharuni Kandha, Chouki Matha, Udayabata, Nimidiha, Kotakula, Rangiagarh, Nua Sandhakud, Musadiha, Musadiha Jangle, Boitarkuda, Kaudia, Aganaasi, and Nuagarh) was sent to the state H. & U.D. Department in 2007.
Companies established in Paradeep include FCO, Paradeep Phosphates Limited, Cargill, the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative, and Goa Carbon Limited.


History[edit]
During the early 17th century, Paradip and its adjoining areas were connected to Cuttack through the Mahanadi river and its branches. Goods were transported to Cuttack from rural areas via the Brahmani and Dhamra rivers, although this was gradually discontinued due to silting of the river bed. 
In 1819, the British constructed a harbour called False Point, north of the present site of Paradip. In 1862, the East India Irrigation Company explored the potential of Paradip for the transportation of rice from the area. The importance of Paradip grew during the great famine of 1866 when it was used as the main entry point for importing food materials into the famine-struck area.

 Inauguration of Paradip Port
During the early post-independence period, a minor port came into existence at Paradip in 1958 through the efforts of the State Government. Subsequently, the Government decided to construct a major port there. The foundation stone for Paradip Port was laid on 3 January 1962 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India. On completion in 1965, the port was taken over by the Government of India and was declared open on 12 March 1966. Paradip Port was declared the eighth major port of India and the first major deep sea port on the east coast commissioned after independence. The Paradip Port Trust came into being in 1967 for the development and management of the Port.

 
Geography[edit]
Paradip is located at 20°10′N 86°24′E﻿ / ﻿20.16°N 86.40°E﻿ / 20.16; 86.40.[5] It has an average elevation of 1 m (3.3 ft).

Located on the Bay of Bengal at a latitude of 20° 55.44' N and a longitude of 86°34.62' E, the port is built on an artificial harbour, with ships accessing the port via man-made lagoons. The port handled over 100 million tonnes of cargo in 2017–2018, notably thermal coal and iron ore.[8]
The port's 55,000 m2 (590,000 sq ft) of paved concrete storage area can hold about 1000 TEUs (20 ft). It has three mobile cranes, an in-house stuffing/destuffing facility, a siding facility, an RO-RO jetty, and single-point mooring.
