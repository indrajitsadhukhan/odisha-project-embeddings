Debakunda or Devkund is naturally created pond located in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, India, and is part of the Simlipal National Park.[1][2] The flowing water from an adjacent waterfall has created this pond. There is a temple called "Ambika Mandira" that was discovered by Rajkumar Prafulla Chandra Bhanja Deo, a researcher and a king during British Raj who stayed at Devkund and researched about this place.[3][4][5] Debakunda is home to lichen species like Parmeliaceae.[6][7]


Location[edit]
Devkund is located at a distance of 50 KM from Udala, 60 km from Baripada and 66 km from Balasore railway station. [8]

Etymology[edit]
Devkund is combination of two Odia words "Deba" (deity) and "Kunda" (a small pond or tub].
