Chandabali (or Chandbali) is an old town in the Bhadrak district of Odisha on the bank of the River Baitarani.[1]


History[edit]
Before the 19th century AD, Chandabali was a small fishing village, and a natural river port. In 1866, trading began from this port to Bengal and in 1881, it was declared a government port by the British government. This led to growth and development of a market for agricultural produce.
In the 1910s, the United States Hydrographic Office noted that the opening of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway had drawn trade away from the port, and that the port was now considered to be simply part of the port of Dhamra.  At the time, the port had between 22 and 30 feet of anchorage, in front of the town, with three landing piers, the water 10 feet deep at their ends.  A steamer service ran four times per week between there and Calcutta.  The town itself had a single police station, a customhouse and warehouse, and a traveler's bungalow.  The 1901 Census of India had recorded the population as 1,826.[2]

Climate[edit]
