Ganjam district is a district in the Indian state of Odisha. Ganjam's total area is 8,206 km² (3,168 mi²).
The district headquarters is Chhatrapur. Ganjam is divided into three sub-divisions Chhatrapur, Berhampur, and Bhanjanagar. The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1908 lists Ganjam, along with the Thanjavur and South Canara districts, as the three districts of the Madras Presidency where Brahmins were most numerous.
As of 2011 it is the most populous district of Odisha (out of 30).[2]


History[edit]
Ganjam was a part of ancient Dakshina Kalinga. The Mauryan emperor Ashoka inscribed his message at Jaugada near the banks of the Rushikulya, in the present-day Ganjam district. Scholars thus conclude that a significant part of Ganjam was under the rule of Ashoka. There are multiple theories regarding the name 'Ganjam'. During the 7th century, the region was known as Kangoda or Kongoda. Some scholars believe the word evolved from this ancient name while others suggest the name of the region likely derives from the Persian word "Ganj", meaning 'granary' or 'market' thus signifying the importance of historical ports and being the respective center of trade and commerce.[3][4]
Ganjam district is one of the oldest administrative units of Odisha. It was part of Madras presidency during British rule.[5]
