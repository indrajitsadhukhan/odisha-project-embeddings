The King was riding a horse and Goddess was following him to Kendujhar. King could know that Maa Tarini was coming behind from the sound of her ornaments but near the ghatagaon in the deep forest the sound of the ornaments didn't came and the king looked back thinking that she's not coming. But Maa Tarini was coming and due to the forest mud her ornaments sounds was not coming. Due to the condition Maa tarini stayed there and worshiped as the queen of Forest.[1]
