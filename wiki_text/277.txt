Raibania fort is a group of ancient forts in Baleswar district, Odisha, India. [1] This fort complex is considered as the biggest medieval fort of eastern India.[1]
It was built during the reign of Eastern Ganga ruler Narasingha Deva I. There are 161 fort goddesses which are as "Durga devata" or "Iṣṫa devata" and Daṣasharu which is an aniconic form of the goddess Jayacaṇḍi.[2]
Although three forts were recorded in the Ain-i-Akbari,[3]
four forts have been found here: two of the larger ones are closer to the village Raibania, and the other two are closer to the village Phulta (Phulahatta).[4]
According to The Balasore Gazetteer, the forts were devastated after the Kalapahada invaded Utkala. Post-invasion remnants of the forts except Raibania have been utilized for construction by the local Zamindars and villagers of the locality.[5]


Location[edit]
The Raibania fort complex is located in Laxmannath, 9 miles (14 km) from Jaleswar and 2 miles (3.2 km) from the river Subarnarekha.[4]
