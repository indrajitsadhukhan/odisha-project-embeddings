A botanical garden is a place where plants, especially ferns, conifers and flowering plants, are grown and displayed for the purposes of research and education. This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with beautiful flowers, are grown for public amenity Botanical gardens that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as arboreta.  They are occasionally associated with zoos. The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in West Bengal is the first of its kind in the South Asia.
