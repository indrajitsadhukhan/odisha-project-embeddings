 Sunset at Chandipur beach
Chandipur, is a beach in Balasore District, Odisha, India. The beach is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal and is approximately 16 kilometers from the Balasore Railway Station. The beach is unique in a way that the water recedes up to 5 kilometers during the ebb tide. Due to its unique circumstances, the beach supports bio-diversity. Horseshoe crab is also found here on the beach towards Mirzapur, the nearby fishing market and community at the confluence of the Budhabalanga River (Balaramgadi). It is a suitable picnic spot. One of Odisha Tourism's Panthanivas (guest house) is situated here.
