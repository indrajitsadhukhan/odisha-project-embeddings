Baladevjew Temple is situated in Ichhapur (Tulasi Khetra), Kendrapara, Odisha, India. Baladevjew Temple is a very famous temple of Odisha and Balarama is its main divinity. However, Jagannath and Subhadra are also worshipped in the Ratna Sinhasan (Gem Throne) in the main temple. An idol representing tulasi as a goddess in a seated position is also present after the sacred seven steps.[1]


History[edit]
The present shrine of Siddha Baladevajew was constructed during the Maratha rule in Odisha (1761 AD) of Ichhapur (Kendrapara). It was constructed by the king of Kujanga, Raja Gopal Sandha and Zamindar (landlord) of Chhedara killah, Srinivas Narendra Mahapatra. One saint (Santha) Gopi Das and Sairatak Giri convinced the then Maratha Chief Janoji and constructed the Jagamohan, Bhoga Mandapa of the main temple, temple of Gundicha and compound wall.
It is believed that Khan-I-Duran, the subedar of Odisha during the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb demolished the temple in 1661 and built a mosque on the remains of the temple. Devotees of Lord Baladev Jeu, took the deity in disguise in a boat through the river Govari and kept the deity in a secret place near Baranga (Chhedara) Jungle. Afterwards it was shifted to Balarampur village near Luna river at Sakhi Bata. Later it was transferred to the present day Icchapur temple.[2]
