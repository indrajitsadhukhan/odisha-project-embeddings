 A Habaspuri sari.
Habaspuri (Odia pronunciation: [habɔsɔpuɾi]) is a cotton-based traditional handloom textiles of Odisha, India. Habaspuri sari is a major product of this textile. The Bhulia weavers of Chicheguda, Kalahandi district, Odisha are originally attributed for weaving of the Habaspuri fabric.[1] For its uniqueness in weaving, design and production, it has been identified as one of the 14 Geographical Indications of Odisha.[2][3] The textile has traditional patterns of the region like kumbha (temple), fish and flowers.
