Deulajhari, the ancient citadel of Shaivism, is located in Deulajhari village in the Angul district of Odisha. This attractive place is having 24 acres (9.7 ha) and 55 decimals of land and covered with indigenous- pandanus forest (kiabana). It is known for a hot spring and a very old ancient Shiva Shree Siddeswar Baba temple.[1] There are 24 hot springs around the temple although temple records say that once there were 84 such hot water springs.[2]
