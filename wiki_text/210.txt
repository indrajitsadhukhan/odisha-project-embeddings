Majhighariani Temple is a shrine to a goddess in the Rayagada township of Odisha.[1] It was built by King Vishwanath Dev Gajapati of the Suryavansh dynasty of Nandapur - Jeypore kingdom. It is believed that he made Rayagada his capital and after the construction of the temple he went on to conquer a vast dominion and expanded his kingdom from parts of Bengal to Telangana in south.[2]
Visitors come to the shrine, especially on Wednesdays and Fridays and for Dussehra in October and Chaitra parva in March–April.[citation needed] The nearest railhead is Rayagada.

History[edit]

According to the Odisha District Gazetteer, the 16th century Suryavanshi king Vishwanath Dev Gajapati moved his capital to Rayagada from Nandapur and built a fort on the Nagavali river, now in ruins, in which he built a temple of the Majhighariani goddess. The fort was later destroyed by the British, who used the stones to build a bridge. The current temple was built in the late 20th century.
