 Satpada
Ramba Bay at the southern end of the lake with the group of islands including:
The Becon Island, with an architectural conical pillar (to put a light on the top) built by Mr. Snodgrass, the then collector of Ganjam of the East India Company, on a mass of rock in the Rambha Bay near Ghantasila hill.  It is surrounded by the Eastern Ghat.
The Breakfast Island, pear shaped, known as "Sankuda island", with remnants of a dilapidated bungalow constructed by the King of Kalikote, has rare plants and is full of greenery with appealing flora.
Honeymoon Island, 5 km (3.1 mi) from Rambha Jetty, known as Barkuda Island, with clear waters has abundant red and green macro algae in the bed is also known for the limbless lizard, an endemic species found here.
Somolo and Dumkudi islands, located in the Central and Southern sectors of the lake, in the backdrop of scenic Khalikote hill range, are inundated remnants of the Eastern Ghats with rich flora and fauna and also known for sighting of Irrawaddy dolphins.
Birds' island, located  in the southern sector of the lake has huge exposed hanging rocks, are painted white due to folic acid of the droppings of the birds and is known for rich algal communities and few mangrove species and also migratory birds in winter.
Parikud is a group of composite islands in the Garh Krishnaprasad Block for nature lovers and provides an avian spectacle during winter season.
Kalijai Temple located on an island is considered to be the abode of the Goddess Kalijai.
Satpada, at the new mouth of the lake, provides a beautiful view of the lake and also views of the dolphins. Hundreds of boats here provide tours of the lake for tourists.
Barunkuda, a small island situated near Magarmukh, mouth of the lake, has a temple of Lord Varuna.
Nabagraha is an ancient deity located along the outer channel.
Chourbar Shiva Temple is located near Alupatna village, along the outer channel.
Manikpatna, located on the outer channel has historical evidence of a port which was used for trade with Far East and also has the Bhabakundeswar temple of Lord Shiva, an old Mosque whose entrance door is made of the jaws of the whale.
Sand-Bar and Mouth of the Lake is a striking and un-explored stretch of 30 km (18.6 mi) of empty beach across the sand bar which separates the lake from the sea.[2]
