Chakresvara Shiva temple is a living Hindu temple built in 10-11 AD dedicated to Lord Shiva at Hatiasuni lane, Rajarani Colony, Bhubaneswar of Odisha, India. The deity, lingam, is in a circular yonipitha inside the sanctum. The temple is surrounded by private residential buildings on its eastern and northern side and chakresvara tank in the west. It is of great significance as rituals like Shivaratri, Diwali, and Sankranti are observed here. Also this temple serves as a purpose of a sacred place for 'Thread Ceremony, Rudrabhiseka, Chandrabhiseka.'

At the base of the doorjamb, there are dvarapala niches on either sides. The niches enshrine two armed Saivite dwrapala holding tridents in their right hands and varada in left hands. The architrave above the doorjamb is beautifully carved with Navagrahas in the niches. Surya holds a lotus in his hands, Rahu holds a half moon and Ketu with a serpent tail.
