History[edit]
Ancient Kalinga era[edit]
Gopalpur has an ancient sea port which was operational during the heyday of maritime Kalinga region. It is identified with the site Mansurkota located near Gopalpur, just below the mouth of the river Rushikulya. Ptolemy refers to an apheterion or the point of departure located south of Palur port from where ships bound for Southeast Asia embarked on its voyage.[4]

Post-Medieval era[edit]
Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma.
Gopalpur on sea, was once a dutch establishment. back in those days Mr. S K Dey owned almost half of Gopalpur.
They also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own.
During the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles.
During the days of British East India Company The East India Company built large warehouses and godowns because the trade with Burma had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from Rangoon.
Victor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in Christian cemetery just a few years ago.
Gopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference — it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own.
Once a house to a Europeans and Anglo Indians now only a few of the families live here.

Beach[edit]
 Panorama view of Gopalpur Sea Beach
Barely 16 km away from Brahmapur (It is also at times considered as a part of Brahmapur), the commercial hub of southern Odisha and close to the border of Andhra Pradesh, is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the Bay of Bengal. This languorous beach with coconut groves, casuarinas and gentle sand dunes is deserted for miles.

Development[edit]
 Entrance to Gopalpur Beach
Renovated in the 1970s at the initiative of the Odisha government, the jetties were supposed to revive the trading activities of Gopalpur port. The old jetty in Gopalpur is tourist attraction point, which was a major point for trade and commerce in medieval times. The sailors of those time started their journey from this jetty to Indonesia and Rangoon across the Indian Sea. Once the renovation of new jetty completed it will become an important port of south Odisha.[5] It's a wonderful drive-in for the people and from the beach, a vast expanse of deep blue sea and the horizon can be seen. Another thrilling sight is the long stretch of cashew nut trees. Cashew nuts are processed here and exported. A major landmark of Gopalpur is its lighthouse. The view from the top is splendid and one can see at a glance the entire town of Gopalpur. Gopalour is also famous for its 'beach festival' organized annually. A nearby beach is Dhabaleshwar, which also houses a temple of the same name. People here can speak English, Hindi, Odia, Bengali and Telugu.
