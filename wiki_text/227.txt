Sri Nilamadhava Temple (Odia: ନୀଳମାଧବଜିଉ ମନ୍ଦିର, କଣ୍ଟିଲୋ) is very old and famous Lord Vishnu temple which is near to the bank of Mahanadi, in Kantilo, Odisha, India. It is present near to the twin hills with a surrounding forest.  A permanent flow of holy water from the feet of Lord Nilamadhava is another attraction of the spot. Lord Siddheswar is also present which is another highlight of the place.
Lord Nilamadhav occupies a central position in the cult of Lord Jagannath. Even now also Lord Nilamadhava shrine is present on the right side of Lakshmi temple in Puri Jagannath Temple.

Here, Biswabasu the local Sabara Chief worshipped Kitung, as the God was known in the Sabara dialect. According to the Puranas, the deity was originally worshipped in the form of an Indranila gem image known as “Nilamadhava". The daru murti came much later.Located near the confluence of three rivers Mahanadi, Kuanria and Kusumi. The temple structure is like the Jagannath temple of Puri. It stands on the right bank of Mahanadi. It is called triveni sangam of Odisha. As there is Beni-Madhava in Prayag, so as here Nilamadhava.

Festivals[edit]
