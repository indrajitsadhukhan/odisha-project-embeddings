 Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala
A Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area of importance for flora, fauna, or features of geological or other interest, which is reserved and managed for conservation and to provide opportunities for study or research. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for the establishment of Protected Areas in India.[1]
Wildlife sanctuaries of India, are classified as IUCN Category IV protected areas. As of January 2023,[update] 567 wildlife sanctuaries were established in India, covering 122,564.86 km2 (47,322.56 sq mi).[2] Among these, Project Tiger governs 53 tiger reserves,[3] which are of special significance for the conservation of the Bengal tiger. The oldest bird sanctuary is Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary near Chennai in Tamil Nadu state, and was established in 1796.[4]
