The idol of Jagannath called DadhiVanana was brought from the temple at Tikiripada and installed here. The idols from this temple were installed there. Jagannath temple at Tikiripada was constructed with the stones of the tomb of Gosinha Daitya, a demon ruling in this area in the past, whose fort is located inside Baisipalli, also known as Gosinhagarh during the epic period. The first temple was constructed in 1850.  It was due to the flood of the Mahanadi in that year. The Jagannath temple at Ranpur was erected by King Udhaba Singh in 1324-1363 AD.
