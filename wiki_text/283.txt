Brahmapur (pronounced [bɾɔhmɔpuɾ]; also known as Berhampur) is a city on the eastern coastline of India. It is famous for beaches and many adventure places. It is one of the fastest growing cities in Odisha. It is well known for the business and trading hub of the state as well as of eastern India. Overall it is also known for its perfect city dimensions due to its area, population, business, institutions, tourists places, communication, etc.[2] Bramhapur is most famous for its street food, silk sarees or pato sarees, temples and many historical places. Bramhapur also dubbed as Food Capital of Odisha, and Silk City of India.[citation needed]


Etymology[edit]
The name of the city is said to have been derived from the name of Lord Brahmeswara, worshipped in a temple at Lathi, 4 km from the main town.[3]

History[edit]
Jaugada, present 35 km away from Brahmapur on the banks of the Rushikulya, was an ancient fort and city existing from 3rd century BC to 7th century AD. Its existence before and after this time period cannot be ruled out. Also called Samapa, it was a provincial headquarter of Maurya Dynasty along with Dhauli as evident from the edicts found at both places. Specific history about the place and civilisation doesn't exist after the Maurya Dynasty and the fort is now buried.[3]
The cult of Buddhi Thakurani originated along with the emergence of Brahmapur town in and around 1672 AD. Telugu Lengayat Dera (weaver) community, who came to Mahuri on the invitation of Raja Saheb of Mahuri to take up their profession of weaving, started Ghata Yatra (Pot Festival) for highlighting the divinity of Mahamayee Thakurani of his capital town Brahmapur. The Chief of the Dera community, Kota Chandramani Kubera Senapati, led his community people to migrate to Mahuri and Brahmapur who settle down into their hereditary profession of weaving tussar silken products or Patta Matha. The Ghata Yatra was initiated for the purpose of highlighting the tradition of worshiping Thakurani as well as to use it as a platform for sales promotion of their silken products.[4][5]
In April 1923, a meeting of the 'Utkal Union Conference' was held at Brahmapur under the  chairmanship of Kalpataru Das. Many Congress workers took part in it. They supported the main idea of amalgamation of the Odia areas under one administration, but differed on the course of action to be taken to fulfil the objective.[3]
It's finally became a part of Orissa Province on 1 April 1936 by amalgamation of Odia-speaking lands carved out from Madras Presidency along with Ganjam district and other Southern Odisha regions.

Geography[edit]
The city is at 19° 20' N Latitude 84° 50' E Longitude. Its average elevation above mean sea level is 24 m.
The town stands on a rocky  ledge 78 feet above the mean sea level, surrounded by an extensive cultivated plain. In a direct line, the distance of the place from the sea is 11 km. On the east and south this plain is open and it slopes towards the sea but on the north and west, it is bounded by the Mohiri or Kerandi hills, some 2500 feet high and about 14 km from Brahmapur.[3]
Brahmapur lies 25 km away from Rushikulya river and in its basin. Several small streams including Sapua nadi and Hati nadi flow through it.
A perfect amalgamation of Odia and Telugu communities can be seen here due to its being very near to the Odisha–Andhra border which turned itself into a major financial hub in Southern Odisha.

Boundaries of the city[edit]
North: Chandaniapahad, Ambagada, Ratnapur, Jagadalpur, Nimakhandi, Luchapda, Bhabinipur, Bada Gumula, Pali Gumula, Sana Kausasthali and Narendrapur.

Administration[edit]

The Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC) of Southern range is located in Brahmapur and covers the undivided Ganjam, Koraput, Kandhamal and Kalahandi districts.
The headquarters for Brahmapur Tehsil, District Education Office (Ganjam) and Brahmapur Sub-Division are also situated here.

Transportation[edit]
Road[edit]
Brahmapur city is connected with National Highways NH-16 (Chennai–Kolkata), NH-59 (Brahmapur-Khariar), NH-516 (Narendrapur-Gopalpur), State Highway 17 (Odisha) and State Highway 22 (Odisha) which connect almost all other cities and towns of Odisha.
Three-wheeler auto taxis are the most important mode of transportation in this city, with Taxis also on the city's roads. Online "C-cabs" and "ola" taxi-service app is also available. The state government has constructed a new bus station at Haladiapadar, at the outskirts of the city. The Ganjam Urban Transport Services Limited (GUTSL) with joint partnership with Odisha State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC) have an agreement to run a city-bus service for Brahmapur to urban centres on its periphery (Chatrapur, Gopalpur and Hinjili, Taratarini, Bhairabi) since 27 February 2014.[9][10]

Train[edit]
Brahmapur Railway Station is a major railway station of Odisha and India. It was first opened in 1896. It is connected with two major stations (Howrah-Chennai) through Howrah- Chennai main route. The railway station is located at the heart of the city. It has a typical British architecture style and has 4 platforms.
It handles mostly passenger traffic while cargo is handled at the nearby Jagannathpur Station.

Air[edit]
The city has an airport at Rangeilunda.[11] The airstrip was in use during British Raj and World War II. However, post independence, it has lied in a dilapidated condition with no scope of expansion due to its adjacence to Berhampur University. Demands for a new greenfield airport have been echoing throughout the years but have remained futile due to government inaction.[11]
In 2018, the airport was selected for developing it into a commercial airport by the government's UDAN scheme. In view of this, in March 2023, it started commercial operations to Bhubaneswar, with flights operated twice a week.[12]

Sea[edit]
The Gopalpur port was recommisioned after renovation and expansion.[13] It is a private port and handles mineral exports and imports. No passenger ships, cruises or ferries operate to or from there as of 2021.

Climate and regional setting[edit]
Maximum summer temperature is 40 °C; minimum winter temperature is 22 °C. The mean daily temperature varies from 33 °C to 38 °C. May is the hottest month; December is the coldest. The average annual rainfall is 1250 mm and the region receives monsoon and torrential rainfall from July to October.
