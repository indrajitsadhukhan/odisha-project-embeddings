Odia cuisine is the cuisine of the Indian state of Odisha. Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy, while nonetheless remaining flavourful.[1][2] Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples.[2] In old times, food was traditionally served on copper plates or disposable plates made of sal leaves.[3]
Odia cooks, particularly from the Puri region, were much sought after due to their ability to cook food in accordance with Hindu scriptures. During the 19th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengal and they took many Odia dishes with them.[4][5]
Yoghurt is used in dishes. Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese).[6]


Ingredients and seasoning
Rice is a major crop of Odisha along with wheat.[7] Lentils such as pigeon peas and moong beans are another major ingredients.
Indigenous vegetables used in Odia cuisine are pumpkin, gourd , plantains, jackfruit, and papaya. Vegetables such as potatoes, cauliflowers, and cabbages are also used alongside local vegetables.
Pancha phutana is a blend of five spices that is widely used in Odia cuisine. It contains mustard, cumin, fenugreek, aniseed and kalonji(onion seeds). Garlic, onion and ginger are used in most of the food. Turmeric and jaggery are used regularly.[2]

Local variation
The food in the region around Puri-Cuttack is greatly influenced by the Jagannath Temple. On the other hand, kalonji and mustard paste are used mostly in every part of the state. In the region closer to Andhra Pradesh, curry tree leaves and tamarind are used more. The Brahmapur region has influences of South Indian cuisine.[8]

Temple food
 Abadha, the afternoon meal of the Jagannath Temple served on a plantain leaf.
Temples in the region make offerings to the presiding deities. The prasada of the Jagannath Temple is well known, and is specifically called Maha Prasad meaning greatest of all prasadas. It consists of 56 recipes, so it is called chhapan bhoga. It is based on the legend that Krishna missed his eight meals for seven days, while trying to save a village from a storm holding up the Govardhan hill, as a shelter.[6]

Fish and seafood
Fish and other seafood are eaten mainly in coastal areas. Several curries are prepared from crab, 
prawn and lobster with spices.[2][9] Freshwater fish is available from rivers and irrigation canals.[4]
