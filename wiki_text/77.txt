Kendujhar District, is an administrative district of Odisha. The district is one of the fifth Scheduled Areas of Odisha.[3][4][5][6] The town of Kendujhar (or Kendujhargarh) is the district headquarters. The district has three sub-divisions, Anandapur, Champua, and Kendujhar.[7]


Etymology[edit]
Origin of the name Keonjhar/Kendujhar is not certain. In the locals pronounce the name as Kenjhar. In medieval Sanskrit inscriptions the name is "Kenjhar" is found. The name has been Sanskritised to Kendujhar by the ex-Durbar government.[8] The name Kendujhar is derived from "Kendu" meaning East Indian Ebony (tree which is abundant in the district) and "Jhar" meaning water spring.[9]

History[edit]
Early history of Kendujhar is not certain. Nagas of Vindhyatabi ruled keonjhar during the second century CE to fourth century CE and Satrubhanja was famous king of the dynasty.[10][11] In Sitabhinji, fresco paintings were found in the cave shelter of Ravana Chhaya, which date to the fifth century A.D.[12][13][14]
Written references about Kendujhar come about early 1100s. Some of the documents refer to Upper Kendujhar and Mayurbhanj together forming a state called Hariharpur. A separate existence of Keonjhar came into being at about 1128 C.E. The founding of the kingdom is credited to Jati Bhanj (Jyoti Bhanj). There were several chiefs of this Gadjat State until Raja Janardan Bhanja signed a treaty with East India Company. This recognised the title of Raja by British Government. There was a succession dispute when the then Raja died without a legitimate heir in 1861. This dispute was finally over with a multiparty compromise with Dhanurjaya Bhanja being crowned king in 1868. However, there was a rebellion that broke out soon after led by Ratna Naik and a few other tribals. This rebellion was quelled with the help of British Police.[15][16][17] There was another tribal uprising in 1891 under the leadership of Dharanidhar Naik against oppressive practices such as bonded labour. This was known as "Dharani Meli".[18] The Raja had to flee to Cuttack and the rebellion was again quelled by British forces.[19][20]
Post Indian Independence in 1947 the whole of Keonjhar State was integrated into the State of Odisha (then Orissa) by "The Administration of Orissa States Orders, 1948". It became one of the 13 districts of the State.[21]

Geography[edit]
Keonjhar is a landlocked district situated in the northern part of Orissa. It is bounded by Mayurbhanj District, Balasore District and Bhadrak District to the east, Jajpur District to the south, Dhenkanal District, Anugul District and Sundargarh District to the west, and West Singhbhum district to the north.
The district of Keonjhar is highly rich in mineral resources and has vast deposits of iron, manganese and chromium ores. About 30% of the district's total area is covered with tracts of dense forests. Keonjhar also contains one of the oldest rock formations in the world, which covers an area of 100 km2.

Topography[edit]
On the eastern half of the district are the plains of Anandapur. To the west is a range of hills containing peaks such as Gandhamardan (3477 ft), Mankadnacha (3639 ft), Gonasika (3219 ft) and Thakurani (3003 ft)[22]
About half of the area of this district is covered by forests of Northern tropical deciduous type trees which include Sal, Asan, Jamu, Arjuna, Kusum, Kangada, Mahua, Mango, Kendu.[23][12][24]
The highlands consist of clusters of rugged crags and the mountaintops appear to be sharply ridged or peaked, however they have extensive tablelands on their summits. In some areas, isolated hills rise abruptly from the plains, but most areas have a general elevation of over 600m. The highlands form the watershed for a number of rivers, including the Baitarani River.[25][26]
